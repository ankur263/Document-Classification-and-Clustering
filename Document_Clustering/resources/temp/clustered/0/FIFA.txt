“2014 World Cup” redirects here. For the oﬃcial video
game of the 2014 World Cup, see 2014 FIFA World
Cup Brazil (video game). For the basketball tournament,

The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World
Cup, the tournament for the association football world
championship, which took place at several venues across
Brazil. Germany won the tournament and took its fourth
title, its ﬁrst since the reuniﬁcation of West and East Germany in 1990, by defeating Argentina 1–0 in the ﬁnal –
the same result as the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final.
The tournament began on 12 June with a group stage and
concluded on 13 July with the championship match.[6] It
was the second time that Brazil hosted the competition,
the ﬁrst being in 1950.
The national teams of 31 countries advanced through
qualiﬁcation competitions to participate with the host nation Brazil in the ﬁnal tournament. A total of 64 matches
were played in 12 cities across Brazil in either new or redeveloped stadiums. For the ﬁrst time at a World Cup
ﬁnals, match oﬃcials used goalline technology, as well
as vanishing foam for free kicks.[7]
All world champion teams since the ﬁrst World Cup in
1930 – Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Uruguay – qualiﬁed for this competition. The title holders, Spain, were eliminated at the
group stage, along with previous winners England and
Italy. Uruguay was eliminated in the Round of 16 and
France was eliminated at the quarterﬁnals. Host and
2013 Confederations Cup winner Brazil lost to Germany
in the ﬁrst semiﬁnal. By winning the ﬁnal, Germany
became the ﬁrst European team to win a World Cup in
the Americas.[8] The result also marked the ﬁrst time that
sides from the same continent had won three tournaments
in a row (following Italy in 2006 and Spain in 2010).[9][10]
As the winners, Germany qualiﬁed for the 2017 FIFA
Confederations Cup. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup,
the FIFA Fan Fest in the host cities in Brazil received 5
million people, and the country received 1 million guests
from 202 countries around the world.[11]
1 Host selection
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup bids
In March 2003, FIFA announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the ﬁrst time
Announcing of Brazil as hosts, 2007
since 1978, in line with its thenactive policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup among diﬀerent confederations.[12][13] With 2010 FIFA World Cup
hosted in South Africa, it would be the second consecutive World Cup outside of Europe, which was a ﬁrst
for the tournament. It was also second in the Southern
Hemisphere.[14] Only Brazil and Colombia formally declared their candidacy but, after the withdrawal of the
latter from the process,[15] Brazil was oﬃcially elected as
host nation unopposed on 30 October 2007.[16]
2 Participating teams and oﬃcials
2.1 Qualiﬁcation
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualiﬁcation
See also: FIFA World Cup qualiﬁcation
Following qualiﬁcation matches between June 2011 and
November 2013, the following 32 teams – shown with
their ﬁnal pretournament FIFA World Rankings[17] –
qualiﬁed for the ﬁnal tournament. 24 out of the 32 teams
to qualify were returning participants from the 2010
World Cup. Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only team
with no previous World Cup Finals experience.[nb 2][18]
Colombia qualiﬁed for the World Cup after 16 years of
absence; Russia and Belgium returned after 12 years. The
highestranking team to not qualify was Ukraine (ranked
16th), while the lowest ranked team that did qualify was
Australia, who were 62nd.[17]

2.2 Final draw
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup seeding
The 32 participating teams were drawn into eight groups.
In preparation for this, the teams were organised into
four pots with the seven highestranked teams joining
host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which
maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6
December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia,
during which the teams were drawn by various pastWorld
Cupwinning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure,
one randomly drawn team – Italy – was ﬁrstly relocated
from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight
teams.[20]
2.3 Oﬃcials
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup oﬃcials
In March 2013, FIFA published a list of 52 prospective
referees, each paired, on the basis of nationality, with
two assistant referees, from all six football confederations for the tournament. On 14 January 2014, the FIFA
Referees Committee appointed 25 referee trios and eight
support duos representing 43 diﬀerent countries for the
tournament.[24][25] Yuichi Nishimura from Japan acted as
referee in the openingmatch whereas Nicola Rizzoli from
Italy acted as referee in the ﬁnal.[26][27]
2.4 Squads
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup squads
As with the 2010 tournament, each team’s squad consists
of 23 players (three of whommust be goalkeepers). Each
participating national association had to conﬁrm their ﬁnal 23player squad no later than 10 days before the start
of the tournament.[28] Teams were permitted to make late
replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up
to 24 hours before their ﬁrst game.[28] During a match, all
remaining squad members not named in the starting team
are available to be one of the three permitted substitutions
(provided the player is not serving a suspension).[28]
3 Venues
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup venues
12 venues (seven new and ﬁve renovated) in twelve cities
were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all
the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 ﬁnals in Brazil.[29] Consequently, the tournament required longdistance travel for
teams.[30] During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were
also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base
camps,[31] as well as staging oﬃcial fan fests where supporters could view the games.[32]
3.1 Team base camps
Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay
and train before and during the World Cup tournament.
On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps
for each participating team,[31] having earlier circulated
a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[34] Most teams
opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only
eight teams choosing other regions; ﬁve teams (Croatia,
Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay
in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South
Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None
opted to stay in the North Region or the CentralWest Region.[35]
3.2 FIFA Fan Fests
For a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA
staged FIFA Fan Fests in each of the 12 host cities
throughout the competition. Prominent examples were
the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do
Anhangabaú.[36][37] The ﬁrst oﬃcial event took place on
Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[38]
4 Innovations
4.1 Technologies
To avoid ghost goals the 2014 World Cup introduced
goalline technology following successful trials at among
others 2013 Confederations Cup. The chosen Goal Control system featured 14 high speed cameras, 7 directed to
each of the goals. Data were sent to the central imageprocessing centre, where a virtual representation of the
ball was output on a widescreen to conﬁrm the goal. The
referee was equipped with a watch which vibrated and
displayed a signal upon a goal.[39][40][41] France’s second
goal in their group game against Honduras was the ﬁrst
time goalline technology was needed to conﬁrm that a
goal should be given.[42]
Following successful trials,[nb 4] FIFA approved the use
of vanishing foam by the referees for the ﬁrst time at a
World Cup Finals. The waterbased spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark
3
a tenyard line for the defending team during a free kick
and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free
kick.[43]
The Adidas Brazuca was the oﬃcial match ball of the
2014 FIFA World Cup[44][45][46][47] and was supplied by
Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[44] Adidas created a
new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani
used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally
bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency
and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet
the approval of football professionals.
4.2 Cooling breaks
Because of the relatively high ambient temperatures in
Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks
for the players were introduced.[48] Breaks can take place
after the 30th minute of the ﬁrst and second half of games
at the referee’s discretion if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeds 32 °C (90 °F).
The ﬁrst cooling break in World Cup play took place
during the 32nd minute of the Netherlands vs. Mexico
Round of 16match.[49][50][51][52] At the start of thematch,
FIFA listed the temperature at 32 °C (90 °F) with 68%
humidity.[53]
4.3 Antidoping
The biological passport was introduced in the FIFA
World Cup starting in 2014. Blood and urine samples
from all players before the competition, and from two
players per team per match, are analysed by the Swiss
Laboratory for Doping Analyses.[54] FIFA reported that
91.5% of the players taking part in the tournament were
tested before the start of the competition and none tested
positive.[55] However, FIFA was criticised for its approach towards ﬁnding doping oﬀences.[56][57]
5 Format
The ﬁrst round, or group stage, was a competition between the 32 teams divided among eight groups of four,
where each group engaged in a roundrobin tournament
within itself. The two highest ranked teams in each group
advanced to the knockout stage.[28] Teams were awarded
three points for a win and one for a draw. When comparing teams in a group overall result came before headtohead.
In the knockout stage there were four rounds (round of
16, quarterﬁnals, semiﬁnals, and the ﬁnal), with each
eliminating the losers. The two semiﬁnal losers competed in a third place playoﬀ. For any match in the
knockout stage, a draw after 90 minutes of regulation
time was followed by two 15 minute periods of extra time
to determine a winner. If the teams were still tied, a
penalty shootout was held to determine a winner.[28]
The match schedule was announced on 20 October
2011[58] with the kickoﬀ times being conﬁrmed on 27
September 2012;[59] after the ﬁnal draw, the kickoﬀ
times of seven matches were adjusted by FIFA.[60] The
competition was organised so that teams that played each
other in the group stage could not meet again during the
knockout phase until the ﬁnal (or the 3rd placematch).[28]
The group stage began on 12 June, with the host nation
competing in the opening game as has been the format
since the 2006 tournament. The opening game was preceded by an opening ceremony that began at 15:15 local
time.[61]
6 Match summary
The 32 teams played a total of 64 matches which included 48 group stage matches, 8 Round of 16 matches, 4
quarterﬁnal matches, 2 semiﬁnals, 1 match for the third
place and the ﬁnal match. Rest days were allocated during the various stages to allow players recovery during the
tournament.[62][63] All times listed in the table below are
in Brasília oﬃcial time (UTC−3).[nb 5]
7 Group stage
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup group stage
The group stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup took
place in Brazil from 12 June 2014 to 26 June 2014: each
team played three games. The group stage was notable
for a scarcity of draws and a large number of goals. The
ﬁrst drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the
13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[70]
The group stage produced a total of 136 goals, nine fewer
than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[71]
This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since
the 32team system was implemented in 1998[72] and the
largest average in a group stage since 1958.[73] World Cup
holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the
quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy’s
from the 1950 tournament.[74]

8.1 Round of 16
For the ﬁrst time since the introduction of a round of
16 after the group stage in 1986, all the group winners
advanced into the quarterﬁnals.[75] They included four
teams from UEFA, three from CONMEBOL, and one
from CONCACAF. Of the eight matches, ﬁve required
extratime, and two of these required penalty shootouts;
this was the ﬁrst time penalty shootouts happened in
more than one game in a round of 16.[nb 6] The goal average per game in the round of 16 was 2.25, a drop of 0.58
goals per game from the group stage.[76] The eight teams
to win in the round of 16 included four former champions
(Brazil, Germany, Argentina and France), a threetime
runner up (Netherlands), and two ﬁrsttime quarterﬁnalists (Colombia and Costa Rica).[77][78] Belgium reached
their ﬁrst quarterﬁnals since 1986.[79]
All times listed below are at local time (UTC−3)
8.2 Quarterﬁnals
With a 1–0 victory over France, Germany set a World
Cup record with four consecutive semiﬁnal appearances.
Brazil beat Colombia 2–1, but Brazil’s Neymar was injured and missed the rest of the competition. Argentina
reached the ﬁnal four for the ﬁrst time since 1990 after
a 1–0 win over Belgium. The Netherlands reached the
semiﬁnals for the second consecutive tournament, after
overcoming Costa Rica in a penalty shootout following
a 0–0 draw at the end of extra time.
8.3 Semiﬁnals
Germany qualiﬁed for the ﬁnal for the eighth time with
a 7–1 win over Brazil – the biggest defeat in Brazilian
history since 1920. Miroslav Klose's goal in this match
was his 16th in all World Cups, breaking the record he
had previously shared with Ronaldo.[80] Klose set another
record by becoming the ﬁrst player to appear in four
World Cup semiﬁnals.[81] Argentina reached their ﬁrst
ﬁnal since 1990, and the ﬁfth overall after overcoming
Netherlands in a penalty shootout following a 0–0 draw
at the end of extra time.
Main article: Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)
8.4 Third place playoﬀ
The Netherlands defeated Brazil 3–0 to secure third
place, the ﬁrst for the Dutch team in their history. Overall, Brazil conceded 14 goals in the tournament; this was
the most by a team at any single World Cup since 1986,
and the most by a host nation in history.[82]
8.5 Final
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup Final
The ﬁnal featuredGermany against Argentina for a record
third time after 1986 and 1990.
Despite the early exit of reigning champions Spain and
previous champions Italy in the group stage, this marked
9.1 Goalscorers 5
the ﬁrst time that teams from the same continent had won
three consecutive World Cups (following Italy in 2006
and Spain in 2010). It was also the ﬁrst time that a European nation had won the World Cup in the Americas.
On aggregate Europe now has 11 victories, compared to
South America’s 9 victories.

9.3 Discipline
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup disciplinary record
The most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan
striker Luis Suárez, who was suspended for nine international matches and banned from taking part in
any footballrelated activity (including entering any stadium) for four months, following a biting incident on
Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was also ﬁned
CHF100,000.[86][87][88] After an appeal to the Court of
Arbitration for Sport, Suárez was later allowed to participate in training and friendly matches with new club
Barcelona.[89]

10 Preparations and costs
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup preparations
Forecasts on the eve of the tournament estimated that
the cost to the Brazilian government would be US$14
billion, making it the most expensive World Cup to
date.[103] FIFA is expected to spend US$2 billion on staging the ﬁnals,[104] with its greatest single expense being
the US$576 million prize money pot.[101]
Although organisers originally estimated costs of US$1.1
billion,[105] a reported US$3.6 billion was ultimately
spent on stadium works.[106][107] Five of the chosen host
cities had brand new venues built speciﬁcally for the
World Cup, while the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha
in the capital Brasília was demolished and rebuilt, with
the remaining six being extensively renovated.[108]
An additional R$3 billion (US$1.3 billion, €960 million, £780 million at June 2014 rates) was earmarked by
the Brazilian government for investment in infrastructure
works and projects for use during the 2014 World Cup
and beyond.[109] However, the failed completion of many
of the proposed works provoked discontent among some
Brazilians.[110][111][112]
The Brazilian government pledged US$900 million to
be invested into security forces and that the tournament
would be “one of the most protected sports events in
history.”[113]
11 Marketing
Main article: 2014 FIFA World Cup marketing
The marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included
sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion
through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the
10 13 CONTROVERSIES
Fuleco, the oﬃcial mascot of the 2014 FIFA World Cup
tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the oﬃcial mascot as well as an oﬃcial video game
that has been developed by EA Sports.[114] The oﬃcial
song of the tournament was "We Are One (Ole Ola)"
with vocals from Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia
Leitte.[115] As a partner of the German Football Association, the German airline Lufthansa renamed itself “Fanhansa” on some of its planes that ﬂew the German national team, media representatives and football fans to
Brazil.[116]
12 Media
See also: 2014 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights
For a fourth consecutive FIFAWorld Cup Finals, the coverage was provided by HBS (Host Broadcast Services),
a subsidiary of Infront Sports & Media.[117] Sony was
selected as the oﬃcial equipment provider and built 12
bespoke high deﬁnition production 40footlong containers, one for each tournament venue, to house the extensive amount of equipment required.[118][119] Each match
utilised 37 standard camera plans, including Aerial and
Cablecam, two Ultramotion cameras and dedicated cameras for interviews.[119] The oﬃcial tournament ﬁlm, as
well as three matches,[nb 7] will be ﬁlmed with ultra high
deﬁnition technology (4K resolution), following a successful trial at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.[120]
The broadcasting rights – covering television, radio,
internet and mobile coverage – for the tournament
were sold to media companies in each individual territory either directly by FIFA, or through licensed companies or organisations such as the European Broadcasting Union, Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana, International Media Content, Dentsu and RS
International Broadcasting & Sports Management.[121]
The sale of these rights accounted for an estimated
60% of FIFA’s income from staging a World Cup.[122]
The International Broadcast Centre was situated at the
Riocentro in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of Rio
de Janeiro.[123][124]
Worldwide, several games qualiﬁed as the mostwatched
sporting events in their country in 2014, including 42.9
million people in Brazil for the opening game between
Brazil and Croatia, the 34.1 million in Japan who saw
their team play Ivory Coast, and 34.7 million in Germany who saw their national team win the World Cup
against Argentina,[125] while the 24.7million viewers during the game between the USA and Portugal is joint with
the 2010 ﬁnal as the mostwatched football game in the
United States.[126]
13 Controversies
Main article: List of 2014 FIFAWorld Cup controversies
The 2014 FIFA World Cup generated various
controversies, including demonstrations, some of
which took place even before the tournament started.
Furthermore, there were various issues with safety,
including eight deaths of workers and a ﬁre during
construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable
makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail
collapse, and the collapse of an unﬁnished overpass
in Belo Horizonte.[127][128][129][130][131] The houses of
thousands of families in Rio de Janeiro were cleared for
redevelopments for the World Cup in spite of protests
and resistance. Favela do Metrô, near the Maracanã
Stadium, was completely destroyed as a result, having
previously housed 700 families in 2010.[132][133][134]
In the tournament itself, controversy centred around
oﬃciating, with international referees including Yuichi
Nishimura, Milorad Mažić, Enrique Osses, Peter
O'Leary, Ravshan Irmatov, Howard Webb, Mark Geiger,
Carlos Velasco Carballo, and assistant Humberto Clavijo coming under criticism for their performances. The
most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan
striker Luis Suárez, who was disciplined after biting Italian player Giorgio Chiellini during a game.

AntiWorld Cup demonstration on the opening day.
Prior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place
outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the
amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the
FIFAWorld Cup.[135] Both the Brazilian president Dilma
Rousseﬀ and FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches
at the 2013 tournament’s opening,[136] which resulted in
FIFA announcing that the 2014 FIFAWorld Cup opening
ceremony would not feature any speeches.[137] Further
protests took place during the Confederations Cup as well
as prior to and during theWorld Cup.[138][139][140][141][142]
13.2 Breaches into stadiums
Further information: List of 2014 FIFA World Cup
controversies § Breaches into stadiums
At the Group B match between Spain and Chile,
around 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way into the stadium
and caused damage to the media centre. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the
events, while others reached the stands. Earlier, about 20
Argentinians made a similar breach during Argentina’s
Group F game against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the
same stadium.[143][144]
13.3 Bridge collapse
Main article: Belo Horizonte overpass collapse
On 3 July 2014, an overpass under construction in
Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure
projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured.[145][146]
13.4 Head injuries
During the tournament, FIFA received signiﬁcant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during
matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most
attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan
defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he
lay unconscious.[147] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for
the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match.
The incident drew criticism from the professional players’
union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of
the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical
committee.[148]
Second, in the Final, German midﬁelder Christoph
Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the
14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing
in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli
whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup
Final.[149]
