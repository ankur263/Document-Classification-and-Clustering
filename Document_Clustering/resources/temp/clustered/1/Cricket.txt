Cricket is a batandball game played between two teams
of 11 players each on a ﬁeld at the centre of which is a
rectangular 22yard long pitch. Each team takes its turn
to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team
ﬁelds. Each turn is known as an innings.
The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts
to hit the ball with his bat away from the ﬁelders so he
can run to the other end of the pitch and score a run.
Each batsman continues batting until he is out. The batting team continues batting until ten batsmen are out, or a
speciﬁed number of overs of six balls have been bowled,
at which point the teams switch roles and the ﬁelding team
comes in to bat.
In professional cricket the length of a game ranges from
20 overs per side to Test cricket played over ﬁve days.
The Laws of Cricket are maintained by the International
Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club
(MCC) with additional Standard Playing Conditions for
Test matches and One Day Internationals.[1]
Cricket was ﬁrst played in southern England in the 16th
century. By the end of the 18th century, it had developed
to be the national sport of England. The expansion of the
British Empire led to cricket being played overseas and
by the mid19th century the ﬁrst international match was
held. ICC, the game’s governing body, has 10 full members.[2] The game ismost popular in Australasia, England,
the Indian subcontinent, the West Indies and Southern
Africa.
1 History
Main article: History of cricket
Early cricket was at some time or another described as
“a club striking a ball (like) the ancient games of clubball, stoolball, trapball, stobball”.[3] Cricket can deﬁnitely be traced back to Tudor times in early 16thcentury
England. Written evidence exists of a game known as
creag being played by Prince Edward, the son of Edward
I (Longshanks), at Newenden, Kent in 1301[4] and there
has been speculation, but no evidence, that this was a
form of cricket.
A number of other words have been suggested as sources
for the term “cricket”. In the earliest deﬁnite reference to the sport in 1598,[5] it is called creckett. Given
the strong medieval trade connections between southeast
England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have
been derived from the Middle Dutch[6] krick(e), meaning a stick (crook); or the Old English cricc or cryce
meaning a crutch or staﬀ.[7] In Old French, the word
criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.[8]
In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from
"cryce, Saxon, a stick”.[9] Another possible source is the
Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool
used for kneeling in church and which resembled the
long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.[10]
According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language
expert of Bonn University, “cricket” derives from the
Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen
(i.e., “with the stick chase”).[11] Dr Gillmeister believes
that not only the name but the sport itself is of Flemish
origin.[12]
The earliest deﬁnite reference to cricket being played in
England (and hence anywhere) is in evidence given at
a 1598 court case which mentions that “creckett” was
played on common land in Guildford, Surrey, around
1550. The court in Guildford heard on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian date, equating to the year 1598 in the
Gregorian calendar) from a 59yearold coroner, John
Derrick, who gave witness that when he was a scholar at
the “Free School at Guildford”, ﬁfty years earlier, “hee
and diverse of his fellows did runne and play [on the
common land] at creckett and other plaies.”[13][14] It is
believed that it was originally a children’s game but references around 1610[14] indicate that adults had started
playing it and the earliest reference to interparish or
village cricket occurs soon afterwards. In 1624, a player
called Jasper Vinall was killed when he was struck on
the head during a match between two parish teams in
Sussex.[15]
During the 17th century, numerous references indicate
the growth of cricket in the southeast of England. By
the end of the century, it had become an organised activity being played for high stakes and it is believed that
the ﬁrst professionals appeared in the years following the
Restoration in 1660. A newspaper report survives of “a
great cricket match” with eleven players a side that was
played for high stakes in Sussex in 1697, and this is the
earliest known reference to a cricket match of such importance.

2 1 HISTORY
Francis Cotes, The Young Cricketer, 1768
The game underwent major development in the 18th century and became the national sport of England. Betting
played a major part in that development with rich patrons
forming their own “select XIs”. Cricket was prominent
in London as early as 1707 and large crowds ﬂocked to
matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury. The single
wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match. In the 1730s Frederick Prince of Wales
played a major role in developing the sport.[16] Bowling
evolved around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the
ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman. This caused a revolution in bat design because, to
deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce
the modern straight bat in place of the old “hockey stick”
shape. The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s
and, for the next 20 years until the formation of MCC
and the opening of Lord’s Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game’s greatest club and its focal point.
MCC quickly became the sport’s premier club and the
custodian of the Laws of Cricket. New Laws introduced
in the latter part of the 18th century included the three
stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
The 19th century saw underarm bowling replaced by ﬁrst
roundarm and then overarm bowling. Both developments
were controversial. Organisation of the game at county
level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with
Sussex CCC in 1839, which ultimately formed the ofﬁcial County Championship in 1890. Meanwhile, the
British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the
game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it
had become well established in India, North America, the
Caribbean, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In
1844, the ﬁrst international cricket match took place between the United States and Canada (although neither has
ever been ranked as a Testplaying nation).
The ﬁrst English team to tour overseas, on board ship to North
America, 1859
In 1859, a team of England players went on the ﬁrst
overseas tour (to North America). The ﬁrst Australian
team to tour overseas was a team of Aboriginal stockmen
who travelled to England in 1868 to play matches against
county teams.[17] In 1862, an English team made the ﬁrst
tour of Australia and in 1876–77, an England team took
part in the ﬁrstever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground against Australia.
W.G. Grace started his long career in 1865; his career is
often said to have revolutionised the sport.[18] The rivalry
between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes
in 1882 and this has remained Test cricket’s most famous
contest . Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when
South Africa played England. The last two decades before the First World War have been called the "Golden
Age of cricket". It is a nostalgic name prompted by the
collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the
period did produce some great players and memorable
matches, especially as organised competition at county
and Test level developed.
The interwar years were dominated by one player: Australia’s Don Bradman, statistically the greatest batsman
of all time. It was the determination of the England
team to overcome his skill that brought about the infamous Bodyline series in 1932–33, particularly from the
accurate shortpitched bowling of Harold Larwood. Test
cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with
the addition of the West Indies, India, and New Zealand
before the Second World War and then Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, and Bangladesh in the postwar period. However,
South Africa was banned from international cricket from
1970 to 1992 because of its government’s apartheid pol2.1 Format of the game 3
Don Bradman of Australia had a Test average of 99.94 and an
overall ﬁrstclass average of 95.14, records unmatched by any
other player.[19]
icy.
Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant. As it was sure
to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative
and the number of matches increased. The ﬁrst Limited
Overs International was played in 1971. The governing
International Cricket Council (ICC) saw its potential and
staged the ﬁrst limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975.
In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20,
has made an immediate impact.
2 Rules and gameplay
Main article: Laws of cricket
Cricket is a bat and ball game, played between two teams
of eleven players each.[20][21] One team bats, attempting
to score runs, while the other bowls and ﬁelds the ball,
attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.
The objective of the game is for a team to score more runs
than its opponent. In some forms of cricket, it may also
be necessary to dismiss the opposition in order to win the
match, which would otherwise be drawn.
There are separate leagues for Women’s cricket, though
informal matches may have mixed teams.
2.1 Format of the game
A cricket match is divided into periods called innings
(which ends with “s” in both singular and plural form). It
is decided before the match whether the teams will have
one innings or two innings each. During an innings one
team ﬁelds and the other bats. The two teams switch between ﬁelding and batting after each innings. All eleven
members of the ﬁelding team take the ﬁeld, but only two
members of the batting team (two batsmen) are on the
ﬁeld at any given time. The order of batsmen is usually
announced just before the match, but it can be varied.
A coin toss is held by the team captains (who are also
players) just before the match starts: the winner decides
whether to bat or ﬁeld ﬁrst.
The cricket ﬁeld is usually oval in shape, with a rectangular pitch at the center. The edge of the playing ﬁeld is
marked with a boundary, which could be a fence, part of
the stands, a rope or a painted line.
At each end of the pitch is a wooden target called awicket,
placed 22 yards apart. The pitch is marked with painted
lines: a bowling crease in line with the wicket, and a batting or popping crease four feet in front of it. The wicket
is made of three vertical stumps supporting two small horizontal bails. A wicket is put down if at least one bail is
dislodged, or one stump is knocked down (usually by the
ball, but also if the batsman does it with his body, clothing
or equipment). This is also described as breaking, knocking down, or hitting the wicket – though if the ball hits the
wicket but does not dislodge a bail or stump then it is not
down.
At any instant each batsman owns a particular wicket
(usually the one closer to him) and, except when actually
batting, is safe when he is in his ground. This means that
at least one part of his body or bat is touching the ground
behind the popping crease. If hiswicket is put down while
the ball is live and he is out of his ground then he is dismissed, but the other batsman is safe.[22]
4 2 RULES AND GAMEPLAY
A ball being bowled. From back to front - umpire (with
hat), wicket, nonstriking batsman (yellow), bowler
(blue), ball, pitch, crease, striking batsman (yellow),
wicket, wicket keeper (blue,crouching) and ﬁelder (blue,
slip position)
The two batsmen take positions at opposite ends of the
pitch. One designated member of the ﬁelding team,
called the bowler, bowls the ball from one end of the pitch
to the striking batsman at the other end. The batsman at
the bowling end is called the nonstriker, and stands to the
side of his wicket, behind his crease. The batsman are allowed to step forward of their creases, though at some
risk. Another member of the ﬁelding team, the wicket
keeper, is positioned behind the striker’s wicket.
The ﬁelding team’s other nine members stand outside the
pitch, spread out across the ﬁeld. The ﬁelding captain
often strategically changes their position between balls.
There is always an umpire at each end of the pitch.
The bowler usually retreats a few yards (metres) behind
the wicket, runs towards it (his runup), and then releases
the ball overhand as he reaches the bowling crease. (If
he crosses the crease before he releases the ball, or if he
ﬂexes his elbow too much in a throw, then it is a no ball,
and the batting team gets a penalty or extra run. If the ball
passes the far wicket out of reach of the batsman then it
is called a wide, also with an extra run.) The ball can be
bowled so that it bounces on the pitch, lands exactly on the
crease (a yorker), or crosses the crease without bouncing
(a full toss).
The batsman tries to prevent the ball from hitting the
wicket by striking the ball with his bat. (This includes
the handle of the bat, and his gloves.) If the bowler succeeds in putting down the wicket the batsman is dismissed
and is said to be bowled out. If the batsman misses the
ball, but any part of his body prevents it from reaching
the wicket, then he is out leg before wicket, or “LBW”.
If the batsman hits the ball but it is caught by a ﬁelder
without bouncing then he is caught out. If it is caught by
the bowler then he is caught and bowled; by the wicket
keeper, caught behind.
If the batsman is successful in striking the ball and it is not
caught without bouncing, then the two batsmen may try
to score points (runs) for their team. Both batsmen run
the length of the pitch, exchanging positions, and grounding their bats behind the opposite crease. Each crossing
and grounding by both batsmen is worth one run. The
batsmen may attempt one run, multiple runs, or elect not
to run at all. By attempting runs, the batsmen risk dismissal. This happens if the ﬁelding team retrieves the
ball and hits either wicket with the ball (either by throwing it, or while holding it) before the batsman who owns
that wicket reaches his ground behind the crease. The
dismissed batsman is run out. Batsmen will sometimes
start to run, change their mind, and return to their original positions.
If the batsman hits the ball over the ﬁeld boundary without the ball touching the ﬁeld, the batting team scores six
runs. If the ball touches the ground and then reaches the
boundary, the batting team scores four runs. The batsmen
might start running before the ball reaches the boundary,
but those runs don't count.
If the batsman misses the ball they can still attempt extra
runs : these are called byes. If the ball bounces oﬀ his
body then it is called a leg bye.
If the striking batsman leaves his ground and misses the
ball, then the wicket keeper can catch it and put down the
wicket - stumped.
In case of a no ball or a wide the batsman can choose
to strike the ball, earning runs in addition to the ﬁxed
penalty. If he does so he can only be dismissed by being run out.
When the batsmen have ﬁnished attempting their runs the
ball is dead, and is returned to the bowler to be bowled
again. The ball becomes live when he starts his run up.
The bowler continues to bowl toward the same wicket,
regardless of any switch of the batsmen’s positions.[23]
A batsman may retire from an innings without being dismissed, usually after reaching a milestone like a hundred
runs (a century).
A dismissed batsman leaves the ﬁeld, to be replaced by
another batsman from the batting team. However, even
though the wicket may have been put down, or the ball
caught, the batsman is not actually dismissed until the
ﬁelding team appeal to the umpires for a decision, traditionally using the expression “How’s that” (or “Howzat”).
2.2 Pitch, wickets and creases 5
In some matches, particularly test matches, either team
may request a review by a third umpire who can use a Decision Review System (DRS), which includes TV replays
and other electronic equipment such as hawk eye, hotspot
and the snickometer.
After a bowler has bowled six times (an over), another
member of the ﬁelding team is designated as the new
bowler, the old bowler taking up a ﬁelding position. The
batsmen stay in place, and the new bowler bowls to the
opposite wicket, so the role of striker and nonstriker reverse. The wicket keeper and the two umpires always
change positions, as domany of the ﬁelders, and play continues. Fielding team members may bowl multiple times
during an innings, but may not bowl two overs in succession.
The innings is complete when 10 of the 11 members of
the batting team have been dismissed (all out – although
one always remaining “not out”), when a set number of
overs has been played, or when the batting team declares
that they have enough runs.
The number of innings and the number of overs per innings vary depending on the format of the match. In a
match which is not a limited overs format the umpires will
usually specify that the last session of the last innings will
have a speciﬁed number of overs.
The match always ends when all innings have been completed. The umpires can also call an end to the match
in case of bad light or weather. But in many cases the
match ends immediately when the ﬁrst team to bat has
played all of its innings, and the last team to bat has more
runs. In fourinnings games the last team may not even
need to play its second innings: this team is said towin by
an innings. If this winning team has not completed its last
innings, and still has, for example, ﬁve batsmen who are
not out or have not even batted, then they are said to “win
by ﬁve wickets”. If the last team to bat is losing, is all
out, and has 10 fewer runs than the other team, then the
winning team “wins by 10 runs”. If the two teams both
play all their innings and they have the same number of
runs, then it is a tie.
In fourinnings matches there is also the possibility of a
draw: the team with fewer runs still has batsmen on the
ﬁeld when the game ends. This has a major eﬀect on
strategy: a team will often declare an innings when they
have accumulated enough runs, in the hope that they will
have enough time left to dismiss the other team and thus
avoid a draw, but risking a loss if the other team scores
enough runs.

A typical cricket ﬁeld.
Cricket is played on a grassy ﬁeld.[24] The Laws of Cricket
do not specify the size or shape of the ﬁeld,[25] but it is
often oval. In the centre of the ﬁeld is a rectangular strip,
known as the pitch.[24]
The pitch is a ﬂat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with
very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game
progresses.[26] At either end of the pitch, 22 yards (20 m)
apart, are placed wooden targets, known as the wickets.
These serve as a target for the bowling (also known as the
ﬁelding) side and are defended by the batting side, which
seeks to accumulate runs.
2.2.2 Stumps, bails and creases
Each wicket on the pitch consists of three wooden stumps
placed vertically, in line with one another. They are surmounted by two wooden crosspieces called bails; the total height of the wicket including bails is 28.5 inches (720
mm) and the combined width of the three stumps, including small gaps between them is 9 inches (230 mm).
Four lines, known as creases, are painted onto the pitch
around the wicket areas to deﬁne the batsman’s “safe territory” and to determine the limit of the bowler’s approach. These are called the “popping” (or batting)
crease, the bowling crease and two “return” creases.
The stumps are placed in line on the bowling creases and
so these creasesmust be 22 yards (20m) apart. A bowling
crease is 8 feet 8 inches (2.64 m) long, with the middle
stump placed dead centre. The popping crease has the
same length, is parallel to the bowling crease and is 4 feet
(1.2 m) in front of the wicket. The return creases are perpendicular to the other two; they are adjoined to the ends

STUMPS
A wicket consists of three stumps that are hammered into the
ground, and topped with two bails.
of the popping crease and are drawn through the ends of
the bowling crease to a length of at least 8 feet (2.4 m).
When bowling the ball, the bowler’s back foot in his “delivery stride” must land within the two return creases
while at least some part of his front foot must land on
or behind the popping crease. If the bowler breaks this
rule, the umpire calls "No ball".
The importance of the popping crease to the batsman is
that it marks the limit of his safe territory. He can be
dismissed stumped or run out (see Dismissals below) if
the wicket is broken while he is “out of his ground”.
2.3 Bat and ball
Main articles: Cricket bat and Cricket ball
Two diﬀerent types of cricket balls:
i) A used white ball. White balls are mainly utilised
in limited overs cricket, especially in matches played at
night, under ﬂoodlights (left).
ii) A used red ball, Red balls are utilised in Test cricket
and ﬁrstclass cricket and some other forms of cricket
(right).
NB Both balls are the same size.
The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers the ball
from his end of the pitch towards the batsmanwho, armed
with a bat is “on strike” at the other end.
The bat is made of wood (usually White Willow) and has
the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The
blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (108 mm) wide
and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches
(970 mm).
The ball is a hard leatherseamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (230 mm). The hardness of the ball,
which can be delivered at speeds of more than 90 miles
per hour (140 km/h), is a matter for concern and batsmen wear protective clothing including pads (designed to
protect the knees and shins), batting gloves for the hands,
a helmet for the head and a box inside the trousers (to
protect the crotch area). Some batsmen wear additional
padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads,
arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads. The ball has
a “seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell
of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on
a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it
in a less predictable manner. During cricket matches, the
quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer
usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus
inﬂuence the match.
2.4 Umpires and scorers
Main articles: Umpire (cricket) and Scorer
The game on the ﬁeld is regulated by two umpires, one
of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler’s end, the
other in a position called “square leg”, a position 15–20
metres to the side of the “on strike” batsman. The main
role of the umpires is to adjudicate on whether a ball is
correctly bowled (not a no ball or a wide), when a run
is scored, and whether a batsman is out (the ﬁelding side
must appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase How’s
2.6 Overs 7
An umpire
That?). Umpires also determine when intervals start and
end, decide on the suitability of the playing conditions
and can interrupt or even abandon the match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp
pitch or deterioration of the light.
Oﬀ the ﬁeld and in televised matches, there is often a
third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is
mandatory under the playing conditions for Test matches
and limited overs internationals played between two ICC
full members. These matches also have a match referee
whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws of
cricket and the spirit of the game.
The match details, including runs and dismissals, are
recorded by two oﬃcial scorers, one representing each
team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an
umpire. For example, the umpire raises a foreﬁnger to
signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he
raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the
ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws of
cricket to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs
bowled; in practice, they also note signiﬁcant amounts of
additional data relating to the game.
2.5 Innings
The innings (ending with 's’ in both singular and plural
form) is the term used for the collective performance of
the batting side.[27] In theory, all eleven members of the
batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an
innings can end before they all do so. Depending on the
type of match being played, each team has one or two
innings apiece.
The main aim of the bowler, supported by his ﬁelders,
is to dismiss the batsman. A batsman when dismissed is
said to be “out” and that means he must leave the ﬁeld
of play and be replaced by the next batsman on his team.
When ten batsmen have been dismissed (i.e., are out),
then the whole team is dismissed and the innings is over.
The last batsman, the one who has not been dismissed, is
not allowed to continue alone as there must always be two
batsmen “in”. This batsman is termed “not out”.
An innings can end early for three reasons: because the
batting side’s captain has chosen to “declare” the innings
closed (which is a tactical decision), or because the batting side has achieved its target and won the game, or because the game has ended prematurely due to bad weather
or running out of time. In each of these cases the team’s
innings ends with two “not out” batsmen, unless the innings is declared closed at the fall of a wicket and the
next batsman has not joined in the play.
In limited overs cricket, there might be two batsmen still
“not out” when the last of the allotted overs has been
bowled.
2.6 Overs
Main article: Over (cricket)
The bowler bowls the ball in sets of six deliveries (or
“balls”) and each set of six balls is called an over. This
name came about because the umpire calls “Over!" when
six balls have been bowled. At this point, another bowler
is deployed at the other end, and the ﬁelding side changes
ends while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two
successive overs, although a bowler can bowl unchanged
at the same end for several overs. The batsmen do not
change ends and so the one who was nonstriker is now
the striker and viceversa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands
behind the wicket at the nonstriker’s end and viceversa.
2.7 Team structure
A team consists of eleven players. Depending on his or
her primary skills, a player may be classiﬁed as a specialist batsman or bowler. A wellbalanced team usually
has ﬁve or six specialist batsmen and four or ﬁve specialist
bowlers. Teams nearly always include a specialist wicketkeeper because of the importance of this ﬁelding position. Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions such as determining the
batting order, the placement of ﬁelders and the rotation
of bowlers.
A player who excels in both batting and bowling is known
as an allrounder. One who excels as a batsman and
wicketkeeper is known as a “wicketkeeper/batsman”,
sometimes regarded as a type of allrounder. True allrounders are rare as most players focus on either batting
or bowling skills.
2.8 Bowling
Main articles: Bowler (cricket) and Bowling (cricket)
8 2 RULES AND GAMEPLAY
The bowler reaches his delivery stride bymeans of a “runup”, although some bowlers with a very slow delivery take
no more than a couple of steps before bowling. A fast
bowler needs momentum and takes quite a long runup,
running very fast as he does so.
The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over
90 miles per hour (140 km/h) and they sometimes rely on
sheer speed to try and defeat the batsman, who is forced to
react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture
of speed and guile. Some fast bowlers make use of the
seam of the ball so that it “curves” or “swings” in ﬂight.
This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into mistiming his shot so that the ball touches the edge of the bat
and can then be “caught behind” by the wicketkeeper or
a slip ﬁelder.
At the other end of the bowling scale is the “spinner” who
bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile
to deceive the batsman. A spinner will often “buy his
wicket” by “tossing one up” (in a slower, higher parabolic
path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot. The
batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are
often “ﬂighted” or spun so that the ball will not behave
quite as he expects and he could be “trapped” into getting
himself out.
In between the pacemen and the spinners are the
“medium pacers” who rely on persistent accuracy to try
and contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman’s concentration.
All bowlers are classiﬁed according to their looks or style.
The classiﬁcations, as with much cricket terminology, can
be very confusing. Hence, a bowler could be classiﬁed
as LF, meaning he is a left arm fast bowler; or as LBG,
meaning he is a right arm spin bowler who bowls deliveries that are called a "leg break" and a "Googly".
During the bowling action the elbow may be held at any
angle andmay bend further, but may not straighten out. If
the elbow straightens illegally then the squareleg umpire
may call noball: this is known as “throwing” or “chucking”, and can be diﬃcult to detect. The current laws allow
a bowler to straighten his arm 15 degrees or less.
2.9 Fielding
Main articles: Fielding (cricket) and Fielding strategy
(cricket)
All eleven players on the ﬁelding side take the ﬁeld together. One of them is the wicketkeeper aka “keeper”
who operates behind the wicket being defended by the
batsman on strike. Wicketkeeping is normally a specialist occupation and his primary job is to gather deliveries
that the batsman does not hit, so that the batsmen cannot
run byes. He wears special gloves (he is the only ﬁelder
allowed to do so), a box over the groin, and pads to cover
his lower legs. Owing to his position directly behind the
striker, the wicketkeeper has a good chance of getting a

Fielding positions in cricket for a righthanded batsman
batsman out caught oﬀ a ﬁne edge from the bat. He is the
only player who can get a batsman out stumped.
Apart from the one currently bowling, the other nine ﬁelders are tactically deployed by the team captain in chosen
positions around the ﬁeld. These positions are not ﬁxed
but they are known by speciﬁc and sometimes colourful names such as “slip”, “third man”, “silly mid on” and
“long leg”. There are always many unprotected areas.
The captain is the most important member of the ﬁelding side as he determines all the tactics including who
should bowl (and how); and he is responsible for “setting
the ﬁeld”, though usually in consultation with the bowler.
In all forms of cricket, if a ﬁelder gets injured or becomes
ill during amatch, a substitute is allowed to ﬁeld instead of
him. The substitute cannot bowl, act as a captain or keep
wicket. The substitute leaves the ﬁeld when the injured
player is ﬁt to return.
2.10 Batting
Main article: batting (cricket)
At any one time, there are two batsmen in the playing
area. One takes station at the striker’s end to defend the
wicket as above and to score runs if possible. His partner,
the nonstriker, is at the end where the bowler is operating.
Batsmen come in to bat in a batting order, decided by the
team captain. The ﬁrst two batsmen – the “openers” –
usually face the hostile bowling from fresh fast bowlers
2.11 Runs 9

and bat are very similar to those used today. The gloves have
evolved somewhat. Many modern players utilise more defensive
equipment than was available to Grace, notably helmets and arm
guards.
with a new ball. The top batting positions are usually
given to the most competent batsmen in the team, and the
team’s bowlers – who are typically, but not always, less
skilled as batsmen – typically bat last. The preannounced
batting order is not mandatory; when a wicket falls any
player who has not yet batted may be sent in next.
If a batsman “retires” (usually due to injury) and cannot
return, he is actually “not out” and his retirement does
not count as a dismissal, though in eﬀect he has been dismissed because his innings is over. Substitute batsmen
are not allowed.
A skilled batsman can use a wide array of “shots” or
“strokes” in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea
is to hit the ball to best eﬀect with the ﬂat surface of the
bat’s blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat it is
called an "edge". Batsmen do not always seek to hit the
ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs
just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or
by simply “blocking” the ball but directing it away from
ﬁelders so that he has time to take a run.
There is a wide variety of shots played in cricket. The
batsman’s repertoire includes strokes named according to
the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., "cut",
“drive”, “hook”, “pull”.

drive
A batsman is not required to play a shot; in the event that
he believes the ball will not hit his wicket and there is no
opportunity to score runs, he can “leave” the ball to go
through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have
to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat. He can
deliberately use his leg to block the ball and thereby “pad
it away” but this is risky because of the leg before wicket
rule.
In the event of an injured batsman being ﬁt to bat but not
to run, the umpires and the ﬁelding captain were previously able to allow another member of the batting side to
be a runner. The runner’s only task was to run between
the wickets instead of the incapacitated batsman, and he
was required to wear and carry exactly the same equipment as the batsman. As of 2011 the ICC outlawed the
use of runners as they felt this was being abused.[29]
2.11 Runs
Main article: Run (cricket)
The primary concern of the batsman on strike (i.e., the
“striker”) is to prevent the ball hitting the wicket and secondarily to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so
that he and his partner have time to run from one end of
the pitch to the other before the ﬁelding side can return
the ball. To register a run, both runners must touch the
ground behind the crease with either their bats or their
bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run). Each
completed run increments the score.
More than one run can be scored from a single hit; but,
while hits worth one to three runs are common, the size
of the ﬁeld is such that it is usually diﬃcult to run four or
more. To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the ﬁeld are automatically awarded four runs if the
ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six
runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the
ground within the boundary. The batsmen do not need to
run if the ball reaches or crosses the boundary.

Brian Lara of the West Indies holds the record for highest score
in both Tests and ﬁrstclass cricket.
Hits for ﬁve are unusual and generally rely on the help
of “overthrows” by a ﬁelder returning the ball. If an odd
number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen
have changed ends, and the one who was nonstriker is
now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs,
but all runs are added to the team’s total.
The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball’s progress, and
this is communicated by calling: “yes”, “no” and “wait”
are often heard.
Running is a calculated risk because if a ﬁelder breaks the
wicket with the ball while the nearest batsman is out of
his ground (i.e., he does not have part of his body or bat in
contact with the ground behind the popping crease), the
batsman is run out.
A team’s score is reported in terms of the number of runs
scored and the number of batsmen that have been dismissed. For example, if ﬁve batsmen are out and the team
has scored 224 runs, they are said to have scored 224 for
the loss of 5 wickets (commonly shortened to “224 for
ﬁve” and written 224/5 or, in Australia, “ﬁve for 224”
and 5/224).
2.12 Extras
Main article: Extra (cricket)
Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as
extras (called “sundries” in Australia) due to errors made
by the ﬁelding side. This is achieved in four ways:
1. No ball: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by
the bowler if he breaks the rules of bowling either
by (a) using an inappropriate arm action; (b) overstepping the popping crease; (c) having a foot outside the return crease. In addition, the bowler has
to rebowl the ball. In limited overs matches, a no
ball is called if the bowling team’s ﬁeld setting fails
to comply with the restrictions. In shorter formats
of the game (20–20, ODI) the free hit rule has been
introduced. The ball following a front foot noball
will be a freehit for the batsman, whereby he is safe
from losing his wicket except for being runout.
2. Wide: a penalty of one extra that is conceded by
the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the
batsman’s reach; as with a no ball, a wide must be
rebowled. If a wide ball crosses the boundary, ﬁve
runs are awarded to the batting side (one run for the
wide, and four for the boundary).
3. Bye: extra(s) awarded if the batsman misses the ball
and it goes past the wicketkeeper to give the batsmen
time to run in the conventional way (note that one
mark of a good wicketkeeper is one who restricts
the tally of byes to a minimum).
4. Leg bye: extra(s) awarded if the ball hits the batsman’s body, but not his bat, while attempting a legitimate shot, and it goes away from the ﬁelders to give
the batsmen time to run in the conventional way.
When the bowler has bowled a no ball or a wide, his team
incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side
has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra
ball. The batsmen have to run (i.e., unless the ball goes
to the boundary for four) to claim byes and leg byes but
these only count towards the team total, not to the striker’s
individual total for which runs must be scored oﬀ the bat.
2.13 Dismissals
Main article: Dismissal (cricket)
2.14 Innings closed 11
There are eleven ways in which a batsman can be dismissed; ﬁve relatively common and six extremely rare.
The common forms of dismissal are “bowled”, “caught”,
“leg before wicket” (lbw), “run out”, and “stumped”. Less
common methods are “hit wicket”, “hit the ball twice”,
“obstructed the ﬁeld”, “handled the ball” and “timed out”
– these are almost unknown in the professional game. The
eleventh - retired out - is not treated as an onﬁeld dismissal but rather a retrospective one for which no ﬁelder
is credited.
If the dismissal is obvious (for example when “bowled”
and in most cases of “caught”) the batsman will voluntarily leave the ﬁeld without the umpire needing to dismiss
them. Otherwise before the umpire will award a dismissal
and declare the batsman to be out, a member of the ﬁelding side (generally the bowler) must “appeal”. This is
invariably done by asking (or shouting) “how’s that?" –
normally reduced to howzat? If the umpire agrees with
the appeal, he will raise a foreﬁnger and say “Out!". Otherwise he will shake his head and say “Not out”. Appeals are particularly loud when the circumstances of the
claimed dismissal are unclear, as is always the case with
lbw and often with run outs and stumpings.
1. Bowled: the bowler has hit the wicket with the delivery and the wicket has “broken” with at least one
bail being dislodged (note that if the ball hits the
wicket without dislodging a bail it is not out).[30]
2. Caught: the batsman has hit the ball with his bat, or
with his hand which was holding the bat, and the ball
has been caught before it has touched the ground by
a member of the ﬁelding side.[31]
3. Leg before wicket (lbw): the ball has hit the batsman’s body (including his clothing, pads etc. but not
the bat, or a hand holding the bat) when it would
have gone on to hit the stumps. This rule exists
mainly to prevent the batsman from guarding his
wicket with his legs instead of the bat. To be given
out lbw, the ball must not bounce outside leg stump
or strike the batsmen outside the line of legstump.
It may bounce outside oﬀstump. The batsman may
only be dismissed lbw by a ball striking him outside
the line of oﬀstump if he has not made a genuine
attempt to play the ball with his bat.[32]
4. Run out: a member of the ﬁelding side has broken or “put down” the wicket with the ball while the
nearest batsman was out of his ground; this usually
occurs by means of an accurate throw to the wicket
while the batsmen are attempting a run, although a
batsman can be given out Run out even when he is
not attempting a run; he merely needs to be out of
his ground.[33]
5. Stumped is similar except that it is done by the
wicketkeeper after the batsman has missed the
bowled ball and has stepped out of his ground, and
is not attempting a run.[34]
6. Hit wicket: a batsman is out hit wicket if he dislodges one or both bails with his bat, person, clothing or equipment in the act of receiving a ball, or in
setting oﬀ for a run having just received a ball.[35]
7. Hit the ball twice is very unusual and was introduced as a safety measure to counter dangerous play
and protect the ﬁelders. The batsman may legally
play the ball a second time only to stop the ball hitting the wicket after he has already played it. “Hit”
does not necessarily refer to the batsman’s bat.[36]
8. Obstructing the ﬁeld: another unusual dismissal
which tends to involve a batsman deliberately getting in the way (physically and/or verbally) of a
ﬁelder.[37]
9. Handled the ball: a batsman must not deliberately
touch the ball with his hand, for example to protect
his wicket. Note that the batsman’s hand or glove
counts as part of the bat while the hand is holding the
bat, so batsmen are frequently caught oﬀ their gloves
(i.e. the ball hits, and is deﬂected by, the glove and
can then be caught).[38]
10. Timed out usually means that the next batsman was
not ready to receive a delivery within three minutes
of the previous one being dismissed.[39]
In the vast majority of cases, it is the striker who is out
when a dismissal occurs. If the nonstriker is dismissed it
is usually by being run out, but he could also be dismissed
for obstructing the ﬁeld, handling the ball or being timed
out.
A batsman may leave the ﬁeld without being dismissed.
If injured or taken ill the batsman may temporarily retire,
and be replaced by the next batsman. This is recorded as
retired hurt or retired ill. The retiring batsman is not out,
and may resume the innings later. An unimpaired batsman may retire, and this is treated as being dismissed
retired out; no player is credited with the dismissal.
Batsmen cannot be out bowled, caught, leg before wicket,
stumped or hit wicket oﬀ a no ball. They cannot be out
bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice oﬀ a
wide. Some of these modes of dismissal can occur without the bowler bowling a delivery. The batsman who is
not on strike may be run out by the bowler if he leaves
his crease before the bowler bowls, and a batsman can be
out obstructing the ﬁeld or retired out at any time. Timed
out is, by its nature, a dismissal without a delivery. With
all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be
dismissed per ball bowled.
2.14 Innings closed
Main article: End of an innings (cricket)
An innings is closed when:
12 3 DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS
1. Ten of the eleven batsmen are out (have been dismissed); in this case, the team is said to be “all out”
2. The team has only one batsman left who can bat, one
or more of the remaining players being unavailable
owing to injury, illness or absence; again, the team
is said to be “all out”
3. The team batting last reaches the score required to
win the match
4. The predetermined number of overs has been
bowled (in a oneday match only, commonly 50
overs; or 20 in Twenty20)
5. A captain declares his team’s innings closed while
at least two of his batsmen are not out (this does not
apply in oneday limited over matches)
2.15 Results
Main article: Result (cricket)
If the team that bats last is all out having scored fewer runs
than their opponents, the team is said to have “lost by n
runs” (where n is the diﬀerence between the number of
runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores
enough runs to win, it is said to have “won by n wickets”,
where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For instance
a team that passes its opponents’ score having only lost
six wickets would have won “by four wickets”.
In a twoinningsaside match, one team’s combined ﬁrst
and second innings total may be less than the other side’s
ﬁrst innings total. The team with the greater score is then
said to have won by an innings and n runs, and does not
need to bat again: n is the diﬀerence between the two
teams’ aggregate scores.
If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have
scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie;
this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side.
In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted
for the match expires before either side can win, then the
game is declared a draw.
If the match has only a single innings per side, then a
maximum number of deliveries for each innings is often imposed. Such a match is called a “limited overs”
or “oneday” match, and the side scoring more runs wins
regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw
cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical
formula, known as the DuckworthLewis method after
its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target
score. A onedaymatch can also be declared a “noresult”
if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have
been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make
normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet
weather.
3 Distinctive elements
3.1 Individual focus
For a team sport, cricket places individual players under unusual scrutiny and pressure. Bowler, batsman, and
ﬁelder all act essentially independently of each other.
While team managements can signal bowler or batsman
to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself
is a series of solitary acts. Cricket is more similar to
baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while
the individual focus in cricket is slightly mitigated by the
importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman
may occupy the wicket for a long time.
3.2 Spirit of the Game
Cricket is a unique game where in addition to the laws,
the players must abide by the “Spirit of the Game”.[40]
The standard of sportsmanship has historically been considered so high that the phrase “it’s just not cricket” was
coined in the 19th century to describe unfair or underhanded behaviour in any walk of life. In the last few
decades though, cricket has become increasingly fastpaced and competitive, increasing the use of appealing
and sledging, although players are still expected to abide
by the umpires’ rulings without argument, and for the
most part they do. Beginning in 2001, the MCC has held
an annual lecture named after Colin Cowdrey on the spirit
of the game.[41] Even in the modern game ﬁelders are
known to signal to the umpire that a boundary was hit,
despite what could have been considered a spectacular
save (though they might be found out by the TV replays
anyway). In addition to this, some batsmen have been
known to “walk” when they think they are out even if the
umpire does not declare them out. This is a high level of
sportsmanship, as a batsman can easily take advantage of
incorrect umpiring decisions.
3.3 Inﬂuence of weather
Cricket is a sport played predominantly in the drier periods of the year. But, even so, the weather is a major
factor in all cricket matches.
A scheduled game of cricket cannot be played in wet
weather. Dampness aﬀects the bounce of the ball on the
wicket and is a risk to all players involved in the game.
Many grounds have facilities to cover the cricket pitch (or
the wicket). Covers can be in the form of tarpaulins being laid over the wicket to elevated covers on wheels (using the same concept as an umbrella) to even hover covers which form an airtight seal around the wicket. However, most grounds do not have the facilities to cover the
outﬁeld. This means that in the event of heavy bouts of
13
Floodlight at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai
bad weather, games may be cancelled, abandoned or suspended due to an unsafe outﬁeld.
Another factor in cricket is the amount of light available.
At grounds without ﬂoodlights (or in game formats which
disallow the use of ﬂoodlights), umpires can stop play in
the event of bad light as it becomes too diﬃcult for the
batsmen to be able to see the ball coming at them, (and
in extreme cases, members of the ﬁelding team).
On the other hand, in instances of good light, batsmen can
utilise sightscreens which enable batsmen to have a white
background against which they can pick out the red ball
(or black background for white ball) with greater ease.
The umpires always have the ﬁnal decision on weatherrelated issues.
3.4 Uniqueness of each ﬁeld
Unlike those ofmost sports, cricket playing ﬁelds can vary
signiﬁcantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of
the pitch and inﬁeld are speciﬁcally regulated, the Laws
of Cricket do not specify the size or shape of the ﬁeld.[25]
The ﬁeld boundaries are sometimes painted and sometimes marked by a rope. Pitch and outﬁeld variations
can have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on how balls behave and are
ﬁelded as well as on batting. Pitches vary in consistency,
and thus in the amount of bounce, spin, and seam movement available to the bowler. Hard pitches are usually
good to bat on because of high but even bounce. Dry
pitches tend to deteriorate for batting as cracks often appear, and when this happens to the pitch, spinners can
play a major role. Damp pitches, or pitches covered in
grass (termed “green” pitches), allow good fast bowlers
to extract extra bounce. Such pitches tend to oﬀer help
to fast bowlers throughout the match, but become better
for batting as the game goes on. While players of other
outdoor sports deal with similar variations of ﬁeld surface
and stadium covering, the size and shape of their ﬁelds are
muchmore standardised. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also signiﬁcantly aﬀect play. These
physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ground. A given ground may acquire a
reputation as batsman friendly or bowler friendly if one or
the other discipline notably beneﬁts from its unique mix
of elements. The absence of a standardised ﬁeld aﬀects
not only how particular games play out, but the nature of
team makeup and players’ statistical records.
4 Types of matches
Cricket is a multifaceted sport with multiple formats
based around playing standard and level of formality and
the desired time that the match should last. A pertinent division in terms of professional cricket is between
matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece, and those limited by number of overs, in
which they have a single innings each. The former, known
as ﬁrstclass cricket, has a duration of three to ﬁve days
(there have been examples of “timeless” matches too); the
latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team
bowls a limit of typically 50 or 20 overs, has a planned
duration of one day only (a match can be extended if necessary due to bad weather, etc.).
Typically, twoinnings matches have at least six hours of
playing time each day. Limited overs matches often last
six hours or more. There are usually formal intervals on
each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for
drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.
Amateur cricketers rarely play matches that last longer
than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a speciﬁed maximum time
or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and
the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares; and limited overs
matches, in which a speciﬁed maximum number of overs
is assigned for each team’s innings individually. These
will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at
the weekend and the ever popular 20 over format during the evenings. Other forms of cricket, such as indoor
cricket and garden cricket remain popular.
Historically, a form of cricket known as single wicket
had been extremely successful and many of these contests
in the 18th and 19th centuries qualify as major cricket
matches. In this form, although each teammay have from
one to six players, there is only one batsman at a time and
hemust face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts.
Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs
cricket began.
4.1 Test cricket

representing those countries that are Full Members of the
ICC.
Although the term “Test match” was not coined until
much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with
two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–
77 Australian season. Subsequently, eight other national
teams have achieved Test status: South Africa (1889),
West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1929), India (1932),
Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992)
and Bangladesh (2000). Zimbabwe suspended its Test
status in 2006 due to its inability to compete against other
Test teams,[42] and returned in 2011.[43]
Welsh players are eligible to play for England, which is in
eﬀect an England and Wales team. The West Indies team
comprises players from numerous states in the Caribbean,
notably Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago,
the Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands.
Test matches between two teams are usually played in a
group of matches called a “series”. Matches last up to
ﬁve days and a series normally consists of three to ﬁve
matches. Test matches that are not ﬁnished within the allotted time are drawn. In the case of Test and ﬁrstclass
cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team
that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.[44]
Since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes.
Some other bilateral series have individual trophies too:
for example, the Wisden Trophy is contested by England and West Indies; the Frank Worrell Trophy by Australia and West Indies and the BorderGavaskar Trophy
between India and Australia.

land in the 1963 season in the form of a knockout cup
contested by the ﬁrstclass county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept
was gradually introduced to the other major cricket countries and the ﬁrst limited overs international was played in
1971. In 1975, the ﬁrst Cricket World Cup took place in
England. Limited overs cricket has seen various innovations including the use of multicoloured kit and ﬂoodlit
matches using a white ball. A “one day match”, named
so because each match is scheduled for completion in a
single day, is the common form of limited overs cricket
played on an international level. In practice, matches
sometimes continue on a second day if they have been interrupted or postponed by bad weather. The main objective of a limited overs match is to produce a deﬁnite result
and so a conventional draw is not possible, but matches
can be undecided if the scores are tied or if bad weather
prevents a result. Each team plays one innings only and
faces a limited number of overs, usually a maximum of
50. The Cricket World Cup is held in one day format
and the last World Cup in 2011 was won by the cohosts,
India. The next World Cup will hosted by Australia and
New Zealand in 2015.
Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the
purpose being to complete the match within about three
hours, usually in an evening session. The original idea,
when the concept was introduced in England in 2003, was
to provide workers with an evening entertainment. It was

commercially successful and has been adopted internationally. The inaugural Twenty20 World Championship
was held in 2007 and won by India, three subsequent
events have been held which were won by Pakistan, England and West Indies respectively. The next tournament
is scheduled to be held in 2014. After the inaugural ICC
World Twenty20 many domestic Twenty20 leagues were
born. First of them was Indian Cricket League which
was a rebel league since it was not authorized by BCCI.
BCCI then formed its oﬃcial league called the Indian
Premier League. The oﬃcial league went on to become
a successful annual aﬀair that attracted players and audience around the globe, while the Indian Cricket League
has been disbanded. After the success of Indian premier league many other domestic leagues were formed in
all major cricketing nations. Recently Twenty20 Champions League was formed as a tournament for domestic clubs of various countries.In this league competition
played between the top domestic teams frommajor cricketing nations.

generally used to refer to the highest level of domestic
cricket in those countries with full ICC membership, although there are exceptions to this. Firstclass cricket
in England is played for the most part by the 18 county
clubs which contest the County Championship. The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the oﬃcial competition was not established until 1890. The most successful club has been Yorkshire
County Cricket Club with 30 oﬃcial titles.
Australia established its national ﬁrstclass championship
in 1892–93 when the Sheﬃeld Shield was introduced.
In Australia, the ﬁrstclass teams represent the various
states. New South Wales has won the maximum number
of titles with 45 to 2008.
National championship trophies to be established elsewhere included the Ranji Trophy (India), Plunket Shield
(New Zealand), Currie Cup (South Africa) and Shell
Shield (West Indies). Some of these competitions have
been updated and renamed in recent years.
Domestic limited overs competitions began with England’s Gillette Cup knockout in 1963. Countries usually
stage seasonal limited overs competitions in both knockout and league format. In recent years, national Twenty20
competitions have been introduced, usually in knockout
form though some incorporate minileagues.
4.4 Club cricket
A typical club cricket match in England.
Club cricket is a mainly amateur, but still formal, form
of the sport of cricket, usually involving teams playing in
competitions at weekends or in the evening. There is a
great deal of variation in game format although the Laws
of Cricket are always observed.
Club cricket is frequently organised in a league or cup
format. Games are limited by either time or overs. Limited overs games usually last between 20 and 60 overs per
innings. A less common, but more traditional, format is
limiting the game by time only. Games can range from
a few hours in the evening to two days long. A modern
innovation is the introduction of Twenty20 competitions,
both as a format in the existing leagues and new leagues
solely based on Twenty20, such as LastManStanding.
Standards of play can vary from semiprofessional to occasional recreational level and club cricket is often enjoyed as much for the social element as for the competition. Most clubs have their own ground to play on regularly, often including a ﬁeld and pavilion or club house.
An exception being 'Wandering Sides’ who use other’s
grounds.
Many leagues have been formed around the world of

varying degrees of professionalism, the oldest being the
Birmingham & District Premier League in around the
Birmingham area of England, founded in 1888.
4.5 Other types of matches
Main article: Forms of cricket
There are numerous variations of the sport played
A game of French cricket in progress in Jervis Bay, Australia
throughout the world that include indoor cricket, French
cricket, beach cricket, Kwik cricket and all sorts of
card games and board games that have been inspired by
cricket. In these variants, the rules are often changed to
make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.
Indoor Cricket was ﬁrst invented in 1970.[45] It is similar
to outdoor cricket except that is played in an indoor sports
hall with 6 players per team. It is extremely popular in
the UK with national championships and multiple independent leagues. Another less formal version of indoor
cricket is played in a smaller arena with a soft ball and
without pads was invented some years later and is commonly played in the Southern Hemisphere, and even has
its own nominal international championships, including
World Cups.
In the UK, garden cricket is a popular version of the sport,
played in gardens and on recreation grounds around the
country by adults and children alike. Although a cricket
bat and ball are generally used, other equipment such as
pads and gloves are not. The exact rules will vary based
on the number of participants and the available space.
Families and teenagers play backyard cricket or tennis
ball cricket in suburban yards or driveways, and the cities
of India and Pakistan play host to countless games of
"Gully Cricket" or "tape ball" in their long narrow streets.
Sometimes the rules are improvised: e.g. it may be
agreed that ﬁelders can catch the ball with one hand after
one bounce and claim a wicket; or if only a few people are
available then everyone may ﬁeld while the players take
it in turns to bat and bowl. Tennis balls and homemade
bats are often used, and a variety of objects may serve
as wickets: for example, the batter’s legs as in French
cricket, which did not in fact originate in France, and is
usually played by small children.
In Kwik cricket, the bowler does not have to wait for
the batsman to be ready before a delivery, leading to a
faster, more exhausting game designed to appeal to children, which is often used in physical education lessons at
UK schools. Another modiﬁcation to increase the pace
of the game is the “Tip and Run”, “Tipity” Run, “Tipsy
Run” or “TippyGo” rule, in which the batter must run
when the ball touches the bat, even if it the contact is unintentional or minor. This rule, seen only in impromptu
games, speeds the match up by removing the batsman’s
right to block the ball.
In Samoa a form of cricket called Kilikiti is played in
which hockey stickshaped bats are used. In original English cricket, the hockey stick shape was replaced by the
modern straight bat in the 1760s after bowlers began to
pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it. In Estonia,
teams gather over the winter for the annual Ice Cricket
tournament. The game juxtaposes the normal summer
pursuit with harsh, wintry conditions. Rules are otherwise similar to those for the sixaside game.
5 International structure
Main articles: International structure of cricket,
International Cricket Council and World Cricket League
The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its
ICC member nations. The (highest level) Test playing nations
are shown in orange; the associate member nations are shown in
yellow; the aﬃliate member nations are shown in purple.
headquarters in Dubai, is the international governing
body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket
Conference in 1909 by representatives from England,
Australia and South Africa, renamed the International
Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current
name in 1989.
The ICC has 104 members: 10 Full Members that play
oﬃcial Test matches, 34 Associate Members, and 60
Aﬃliate Members.[46] The ICC is responsible for the
organisation and governance of cricket’s major international tournaments, notably the Cricket World Cup. It
also appoints the umpires and referees that oﬃciate at
17
all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and
Twenty20 Internationals. Each nation has a national
cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in
its country. The cricket board also selects the national
squad and organises home and away tours for the national
team. In the West Indies these matters are addressed by
theWest Indies Cricket Board which consists of members
appointed by four national boards and two multinational
boards.
5.1 Members
Main article: List of International Cricket Council
members
5.1.1 Full Members
Full Members are the governing bodies for cricket in a
country or associated countries. Full Members may also
represent a geographical area. All Full Members have a
right to send one representative team to play oﬃcial Test
matches. Also, all Full Member nations are automatically
qualiﬁed to play ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals.[47]
West Indies cricket team does not represent one country instead an amalgamation of over 20 countries from
the Caribbean. The English Cricket team represents both
England and Wales.
*Last Updated: 8 March 2015 | AResigned May 1961,
readmitted 10 July 1991.
5.1.2 Top Associate and Aﬃliate Members
All the associate and aﬃliate members are not qualiﬁed
to play Test Cricket, however ICC grants One Day International status to its associate and aﬃliate members
based on their success in the World Cricket League. The
top six teams will be awarded One day international and
Twenty20 International status, which will allow the associate and aﬃliate teams to be eligible to play the full
members and play oﬃcial ODI cricket.
The associate and aﬃliate teams who currently hold ODI
and T20I status:
6 Statistics
Main article: Cricket statistics
Organized cricket lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and
has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. At
the professional level, statistics for Test cricket, oneday
internationals, and ﬁrstclass cricket are recorded separately. However, since Test matches are a form of ﬁrstclass cricket, a player’s ﬁrstclass statistics will include his
Test match statistics – but not vice versa. The Guide to
Cricketers was a cricket annual edited by Fred Lillywhite
between 1849 and his death in 1866. Wisden Cricketers’
Almanack was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer
John Wisden (1826–1884) as a competitor to The Guide
to Cricketers. Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running
sports annual in history.
Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most cricket
fans. The basic batting statistics include:
� Innings (I): The number of innings in which the batsman actually batted.
� Not outs (NO): The number of times the batsman
was not out at the conclusion of an innings they batted in.
� Runs (R): The number of runs scored.
� Highest score (HS/Best): The highest score ever
made by the batsman.
� Batting average (Ave): The total number of runs divided by the total number of innings in which the
batsman was out. Ave = Runs/[I – NO] (also Avge
or Avg.)
� Centuries (100): The number of innings in which
the batsman scored one hundred runs or more.
� Halfcenturies (50): The number of innings in
which the batsman scored ﬁfty to ninetynine runs
(centuries do not count as halfcenturies as well).
� Balls faced (BF): The total number of balls received,
including no balls but not including wides.
� Strike rate (SR): The number of runs scored per 100
balls faced. (SR = [100 * Runs]/BF)
� Run rate (RR): Is the number of runs a batsman (or
the batting side) scores in an over of six balls.
The basic bowling statistics include:
� Overs (O): The number of overs bowled.
� Balls (B): The number of balls bowled. Overs is
more traditional, but balls is a more useful statistic because the number of balls per over has varied
historically.
� Maiden overs (M): The number of maiden overs
(overs in which the bowler conceded zero runs)
bowled.
� Runs (R): The number of runs conceded.
18 8 SEE ALSO
� Wickets (W): The number of wickets taken.
� No balls (Nb): The number of no balls bowled.
� Wides (Wd): The number of wides bowled.
� Bowling average (Ave): The average number of runs
conceded per wicket. (Ave = Runs/W)
� Strike rate (SR): The average number of balls
bowled per wicket. (SR = Balls/W)
� Economy rate (Econ): The average number of runs
conceded per over. (Econ = Runs/overs bowled).
6.1 Scorecards
See also: Scoring (cricket)
A match’s statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior
to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was
done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on
tally sticks. The earliest known scorecards were printed in
1776 by Pratt, scorer to the Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club,
but it was many years before his invention was widely
adopted.[49] Scorecards were printed and sold at Lord’s
for the ﬁrst time in 1846.[50]
The introduction of scoreboards revolutionised cricket
by allowing spectators to keep track of the day’s play.
In 1848, Fred Lillywhite used a portable printing press
at grounds to print updated scorecards. In 1858, the
Kennington Oval introduced the ﬁrst mobile scorebox,
“a house on rollers with ﬁgures for telegraphing on each
side”. In 1881, the Melbourne Cricket Ground erected
the ﬁrst cricket scoreboard. The scoreboard, located at
the western end of the ground, gave the batsman’s name
and method of dismissal.[49]
7 In popular culture
7.1 Inﬂuence on everyday life
Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both
in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere. Cricket
has had an inﬂuence on the lexicon of these nations,
especially the English language, with such phrases as
“that’s not cricket” (unfair), “had a good innings”, “sticky
wicket”, and “bowled over”. There have been many
cricket ﬁlms. The term “Bradmanesque” from Don Bradman’s name has become a generic term for outstanding
excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.[51]
The amateur game has also been spread further aﬁeld by
expatriates from the Testplaying nations.
Impromptu games of cricket in the street are common throughout
India.
7.2 Books and games
See also: Cricket in ﬁction
C.L.R. James’s Beyond a Boundary is a popular book
about the sport. In ﬁction, there is English Author P. G.
Wodehouse's 1909 novel, Mike.
Cricket is a popular motif in sportsrelated video games.
Examples include Cricket Life 1 for the PC. See also list
of Cricket video games.
7.3 Inﬂuence on other sports
Cricket has a close relationship with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both
sports.[52] In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom
Wills called for the formation of a “football club” with “a
code of laws” to keep cricketers ﬁt during the oﬀseason.
The following year, Wills and other Victorian cricketers
founded the Melbourne Football Club and codiﬁed the
ﬁrst laws of the game.[53] It is typically played onmodiﬁed
cricket ﬁelds and borrows terminology from cricket, such
as “umpire” and “sledging”.
In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, Englishborn Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was responsible for the “development of the box score, tabular
standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average,
and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball".[54] The statistical record is so central to
the game’s “historical essence” that Chadwick came to be
known as Father of Baseball.[54][55]
